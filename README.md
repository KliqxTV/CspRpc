# CspRpc
A modernized version of [https://github.com/miathetrain/csprp](miathetrain/csprp), upgraded to .NET 8/9 and with a streamlined API.

## TODO
There's a few plans I have for this, which you can adapt to your own needs:

- Periodic screenshotting of CSP, uploading those to a server and using it as the `LargeImageKey`
- Showing the file name of the currently opened file (process command-line? window title? process memory reads?)
